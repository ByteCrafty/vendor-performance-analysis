# vendor-performance-analysis
End-to-end vendor performance analysis in retail using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Covers data ingestion, EDA, and dashboards to track KPIs like sales, purchases, gross profit, margin, unsold capital, and brand-wise vendor insights. Helps identify top/low vendors, optimize pricing, and boost profitability.
## Project Overview
This project analyzes vendor performance in the retail and wholesale industry to help optimize profitability, inventory turnover, and vendor selection.
The analysis covers:
Identifying top vendors contributing to sales and profit.
Detecting underperforming brands/vendors needing price or promotional adjustments.
Assessing the impact of bulk purchases on costs.
Evaluating unsold capital and inventory efficiency.
Comparing profitability across vendors to guide better sourcing decisions.

## Business Problem
Effective inventory and sales management is critical in retail/wholesale. Companies risk losses from:
Inefficient pricing strategies
Poor inventory turnover
Vendor dependency
High freight costs
This analysis provides actionable insights into vendor performance to support procurement, pricing, and sales strategy decisions.
